# lokeswaran.dev

This is my [personal website](https://lokeswaran.dev) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The website is hosted on Vercel and uses Vercel Analytics for tracking.

## Features

- **MDX support**: I use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to render MDX files.
- **Syntax highlighting**: I use [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) to highlight code blocks.
- **Responsive design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices.
