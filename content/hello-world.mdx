## Hello world

As a software engineer, I have always wanted to build a portfolio website. After multiple incomplete attempts I finally built this app. I hope you like it ❤️ This time, I took a different approach and embraced minimal design. I took inspiration from [@leeerob](https://leerob.io/) and [@Ibelick](https://ibelick.com/) portfolios.

### Why Minimal Design?

- **Focus:** Prioritizing content and functionality over flashy elements.
- **Clarity:** A simple interface that guides users intuitively.
- **Completion:** Stripping away the non-essentials led to a project that truly reflects my skills and style.

### Here's what you'll find:

- My Journey: The highs and lows that brought me here.
- Projects: Showcasing problem-solving skills.
- Blog: Thoughts on tech trends and software engineering.

### Techs I used to build this

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) for mdx blogging
- [Ibelick button](https://buttons.ibelick.com/)
- [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) plugin for syntax highlighting in the blog
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment

### Thinks i learnt while building this

- Generating dynamic metadata for my blogs for SEO
- Opengraph image and generating dynamic og image in nextjs
- Use [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to render mdx files
- Use [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) plugin to render the code snippets with one-dark theme and syntax highlight code in the blog

### TODO

- Add tags and filter blog by tags
- Add tooltip for buttons
- Add view count for the blog posts
- Add email subscription for the blog

If you're facing struggles with building your portfolio, my advice is simple: **KISS**(Keep It Simple, Stupid).
